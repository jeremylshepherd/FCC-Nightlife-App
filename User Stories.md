### Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

- [x] User Story: As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area.

- [x] User Story: As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight.

- [x] User Story: As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there.

- [x] User Story: As an unauthenticated user, when I login I should not have to search again.

##### Hint: Try using the Yelp API to find venues in the cities your users search for. If you use Yelp's API, be sure to mention so in your app.
**_I chose to use Google Places_**

Once you've finished implementing these user stories, click the **_"I've completed this challenge"_** button and enter the URLs for both your GitHub repository and your live app running on Heroku.
